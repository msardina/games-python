### Understanding the blocks

Guessing your over 7 or 8 years old these blocks shoud be self explainetory.

### Motion

move(num) will move your sprite foward depending on your direction(It will move by num)

turn right (num) will turn your sprite right by num

turn left (num) will turn your sprite left by num


The next 3 are the same block

goto random position    will go to  a random position

goto other sprites      will go to other sprites

goto x: num, y: num   will goto a position.(Goto the chapter X, Y to understand better)
